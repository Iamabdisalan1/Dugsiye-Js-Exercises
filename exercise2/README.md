⚖️ JavaScript Exercise: Comparison Operators
This repository contains exercises focused on Comparison Operators in JavaScript, which are used to determine equality or differences between values.

📝 Key Concepts
I practiced using the following operators to compare values:

Equal to (==): Checks if two values are equal (ignores type).

Not equal to (!=): Checks if two values are not equal.

Strictly equal to (===): Checks if values are equal and have the same type.

Strictly not equal to (!==): Checks if values are not equal or not the same type.

Greater than (>): Checks if the left value is larger.

Less than (<): Checks if the left value is smaller.

Greater than or equal to (>=): Checks if the left is larger or equal.

Less than or equal to (<=): Checks if the left is smaller or equal.

🚀 How to Test
Run the script in your terminal to see the comparison results:
